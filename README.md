# CSS Practise

This repository is where I display my progress with learning CSS. I have started with raw CSS before moving onto SCSS and CSS frameworks so that I understand CSS fundamentals before having the luxury of high-level abstractions.

With that said, this repository currently contains two examples:

1. NavbarPractise
    - This folder contains a floating navigation bar, which can be seen in the gif.
    - With this, I was able to learn/practise...
        - The box model, by using padding, borders, border radius, and margins
        - Floating items left and right
        - Centring items vertically and horizontally
        - Many different CSS units (e.g., `vw`, `%`)
        - Variables (i.e., custom properties), CSS functions, and shorthand properties
        - `position: fixed;`
        - A few pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements (e.g., `:hover`)

2. GridPractise
    - This folder contains a sample of my practise with using grid layout (and gradients).
